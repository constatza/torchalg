# Preconditioners

`torchalg.preconditioners` defines the preconditioner abstraction,
predictor ports, and concrete torch-native preconditioner implementations.

`base.py` and `ports.py` are interface layers. Solver orchestration should
depend on those abstractions; `factories.py` is the composition root that may
instantiate concrete implementations such as `Identity`.

Implementation modules keep validation local to their own scheduling or
factorization rules. `ScheduledPreconditioner` rejects negative `start_iter`
and negative bounded windows, and `NeuralPreconditioner` binds extra tensors
against the same public `extra_input_names` contract used by solver factories.
